Filter FILEs by printing (some of their) filespecs to standard output.
Like "grep --files-with-matches" with sed capabilities instead of simple grep
filtering.
The SED-SCRIPT must use the "F" command on accepted FILEs. (It can do this
multiple times; the results are made unique.)
Exits 1 if no file is accepted at all.
