# sed CLI extensions

_Additions and tweaks to the sed command._

These are some personal aliases, shortcuts, and extensions that make (my) work with `sed` easier and faster. Some of them may be specific to my environment and workflow, but maybe someone finds a valuable nugget in there.

### Installation

Download all / some selected extensions (note that some have dependencies, though) and put them somewhere in your `PATH`, or just add the `./bin` subdirectory to `PATH`. You can then invoke them via `sed-SUBCOMMAND`.
